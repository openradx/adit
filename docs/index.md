# ADIT - Automated DICOM Transfer

ADIT (Automated DICOM Transfer) is a Swiss army knife to exchange DICOM data between various systems by using a convenient web frontend.

## Why ADIT?

Medical imaging workflows today face significant challenges when moving DICOM data between different systems. ADIT addresses these critical pain points.

## What ADIT Does

ADIT serves as a central hub for medical imaging data, connecting various DICOM systems and enabling secure, controlled data exchange with modern web technologies.

### How It Works

**ADIT acts as an intelligent bridge** between traditional DICOM systems and modern applications:

1. **Data Discovery**: Connect to multiple PACS systems and search for studies using familiar web interfaces
2. **Secure Retrieval**: Fetch DICOM data using established hospital protocols while maintaining security
3. **Privacy Protection**: Automatically pseudonymize patient data during transfer to protect privacy
4. **Format Conversion**: Convert DICOM images to NIfTI format for neuroimaging research and analysis
5. **Modern Access**: Provide web-friendly APIs that work with any programming language or web application
6. **Automated Processing**: Handle single transfers or batch operations with full audit trails

**Perfect for**: Research institutions, clinical trials, multi-site studies, neuroimaging research, and any scenario requiring secure DICOM data exchange between different systems.

### **NIfTI Conversion Capabilities**

ADIT includes built-in support for converting DICOM images to **NIfTI (Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative)** format, making medical imaging data accessible to a wide range of neuroimaging and research tools.

**Use Cases:**

- **Functional MRI (fMRI)** analysis and brain activation mapping
- **Structural MRI** analysis including volumetric measurements
- **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)** and white matter tractography
- **Machine Learning** applications with standardized input format
- **Multi-site studies** with consistent data format across institutions
- **Longitudinal studies** tracking brain changes over time

**Key Benefits:**

- **Automated conversion** during transfer - no manual processing required
- **Maintains image quality** and spatial information from original DICOM
- **Preserves metadata** for research traceability
- **Cross-platform compatibility** works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Integration ready** for research pipelines and analysis workflows

Simply enable the "Convert to NIfTI" option during selective or batch transfers, and ADIT will automatically generate research-ready NIfTI files alongside or instead of DICOM data.

**Ready to modernize your medical imaging workflows?** ADIT bridges the gap between traditional DICOM infrastructure and modern application development, making medical imaging data as accessible as any other web API.
