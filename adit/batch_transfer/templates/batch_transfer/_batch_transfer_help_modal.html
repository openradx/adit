    <p>
        With this form you can create a new batch transfer job to transfer studies from a source server to a destination.
        Batch transfer jobs are put into a queue and will be processed by a worker when the time is right. You will get an
        Email when the job is finished (or failed for some reason).
    </p>
    <p>
        Each batch transfer job contains several transfer tasks that define what studies to transfer. This data must be
        specified in a CSV file with <strong>semicolons <mark>;</mark> as column separators</strong>. If your data is in an
        Excel file then it can be exported to a CSV file. The first row of the CSV file must contain the header with the
        column titles. The following rows contain the data that identifies the studies to transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
        The required PatientID and StudyInstanceUID can be fetched by doing a "Batch Query". The resulting CSV file of a
        batch query can be used with minimal modifications for a batch transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong class="text-danger">Cave!</strong>
        <br />
        If PatientID or AccessionNumber contains leading zeros those are relevant as it is not a number but a text
        identifier. So make sure after loading or saving a CSV file with Excel those values are correct. It's always a good
        idea to view the CSV file with a text editor and check if the format is correct. If not then you must use another
        CSV editor or force the Excel data importer to skip the automatic type conversion (see <a href="https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/stop-excel-convert-text-to-number-date-format-csv-file/">Stop Excel
        from Converting Text to Number</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        The following columns must be defined in the CSV file:
        <dl>
            <dt>
                PatientID
            </dt>
            <dd>
                The unique ID of the patient in the PACS.
            </dd>
            <dt>
                StudyInstanceUID
            </dt>
            <dd>
                A unique ID that identifies the study.
            </dd>
            <dt>
                SeriesInstanceUID
            </dt>
            <dd>
                A unique ID that identifies the series.
            </dd>
            <dt>
                Pseudonym
            </dt>
            <dd>
                A pseudonym to pseudonymize the images during transfer.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </p>
    <p>
        The "SeriesInstanceUID" is optional. If provided, only the specified series of the study will be transferred. The
        provided pseudonym is optional if you have the permissions to transfer unpseudonymized. It will be set as PatientID
        and PatientName. So it is recommended to use cryptic identifier strings (e.g. "XFE3TEW2N").
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure that your CSV file encoding is correct by opening it with a normal text editor (ideally under Windows).
        Especially look that umlauts (äöü) are correct. If something is wrong then try to export your CSV file from Excel
        with UTF-8 encondig.
